# Getting Started

### Swach is a robust color management tool for the modern age. It allows you to collect colors and organize them into palettes.

Swach was created by [Ship Shape](https://shipshape.io/) and is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Supported Platforms

- macOS High Sierra (10.13) or newer
- Windows 8 or newer
- Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
- Other various linux distros (coming soon)

## Download Swach

Swach is 100% free, no strings attached. If you enjoy using it, we would appreciate any donations
to its continued development! You can sponsor us [on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/rwwagner90).

## Beta

Swach is currently in beta, and these docs are a work in progress. We hope the app is intuitive
to use, and does not have bugs, but if you have issues or questions, please email us at <a class="text-alt hover:text-color1" href="mailto:swach@shipshape.io">swach@shipshape.io</a>.
