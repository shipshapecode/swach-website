# Contrast Checker

The contrast checker helps you ensure your color combinations are always accessible and adhere to the [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) standards.

#### Usage

To use the WCAG contrast checker, select it from the menu in the top
left of Swach's menubar or open it with the [keyboard shortcut](/docs/shortcuts).

#### What the scores mean

* **Fail** – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background. You probably want to make it darker. This is a score of less than **3.0**.
* **AA Large** – The smallest acceptable amount of contrast for type sizes of 18pt and larger. This is a score of at least **3.0**.
* **AA** – This is the sweet spot for text sizes below ~18pt. This is a score of at least **4.5**.
* **AAA** – This is enhanced contrast with a score of at least **7.0**. Think longer form articles that will be read for a significant period of time.
